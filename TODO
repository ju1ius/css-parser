New Lexer:
  MULTIBYTE mb_ereg + mb_strlen -> DONE
  ASCII pcre + strlen -> TBD
  write tests
  performance:
    write a css splitter that adds newlines after each {, }, and ;
    that are not part of a string (and not followed by a newline ?).
    This involves a proper lexer.

New Parser:
  !!! Error handling in non-strict mode
  rewrite tests

Encoding:
  figure out what to do with unicode escapes:
    should they be left as is in strings ? => YES
    should they be left as is in identifiers ? => CONVERT IF POSSIBLE

API:
  ParserFactory:
    determines which lexer to use from source encoding

Tests:
  selectors
  list-style shorthands


CSSOM:
  setCssText() methods ?
  DOMDocument extensions ?


Parser:
  background-size syntax in background shorthand
  border-radius
