New Lexer:
  cleanup mb_* functions when in ascii mode
  write tests
  encoding:
    - consider supporting only ascii and utf-8, eg by converting to utf-8
      when it's neither ascii nor utf-8 ?
      Would allow using pcre only and ease inlining calls to match(),
      along with other internal string comparisons
  performance:
    - long lines (for pre-optimized css):
      write a css splitter that adds newlines after each {, }, and ;
      that are not part of a string (and not followed by a newline ?).
      This involves a proper lexer.


New Parser:
  Error handling in non-strict mode:
    keyframes
    nested rulesets
  Fix _isAsciiCaseInsensitiveMatch()
  rewrite tests

Encoding:
  figure out what to do with unicode escapes:
    should they be left as is in strings ? => YES
    should they be left as is in identifiers ? => CONVERT IF POSSIBLE

API:
  ParserFactory:
    determines which lexer to use from source encoding

Tests:
  selectors
  list-style shorthands


CSSOM:
  setCssText() methods ?
  DOMDocument extensions ?


Parser:
  background-size syntax in background shorthand
  border-radius
