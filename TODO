README

Encoding:
  figure out what to do with unicode escapes:
    should they be left as is in strings ?
    should they be left as is in identifiers ?

API:
  Parser::parse
    call StyleSheetLoader::load ?

Tests:
  selectors
  list-style shorthands


CSSOM:
  setCssText() methods ?
  DOMDocument extensions ?


Parser:
  background-size syntax in background shorthand
  border-radius
  The parser code is starting to be a bit hairy:
    Should I use a parser generator ?
      + maintainability
      - performance ?
